\maketitle

\begin{abstract} \textbf{Summary:} We present \texttt{termal}, a fast,
  interactive terminal-based viewer for multiple sequence alignments (MSAs),
  designed for use on remote systems such as high-performance computing (HPC)
  clusters. Unlike traditional graphical viewers, \texttt{termal} runs entirely
  within a terminal and offers features such as scrolling, zooming,
  consensus/conservation visualization, and customizable color schemes. It is
  implemented in Rust, ensuring high performance and minimal dependencies.

  \textbf{Availability and implementation:} \texttt{termal} is written in Rust
  and freely available under the MIT license at
  \url{https://github.com/youruser/termal}.

\section*{Introduction}

Visualising multiple sequence alignments (MSAs)is a common task in computational
biology, yet many alignment viewers have a graphical user interface (GUI) and
are hence unsuitable for use on headless or remote systems such as HPC clusters.
While command-line tools such as \texttt{showalign}\cite{emboss} do exist, they
are typically limited in interactivity and display features. Among these,
Alan\cite{alan} stands out as a particularly elegant solution, leveraging
standard Unix tools such as \texttt{less} and \texttt{awk} to enable minimalist
inspection of MSAs ---  indeed, it served as the initial inspiration for the
present work. This means, however, that Alan's interactivity is limited to that
of a pager: features such as zooming, reordering seqences, as well as computing
and displaying a consensus sequence are absent. While \texttt{showalign} can
compute a consensus, it does not support coloring residues, and the user must
explicitly call a pager in order to scroll through the alignment. 

In this work we introduce \texttt{termal}, which addresses this gap by providing
a responsive, feature-rich terminal interface for exploring MSAs.
\texttt{termal} builds on Alan’s philosophy of terminal-first simplicity, but
provides a richer and more responsive user experience by incorporating a fully
interactive terminal UI and enhanced alignment rendering.

\section*{Comparison with Existing Tools}

We compared \texttt{termal} with existing terminal-based viewers including
\texttt{alv} and \texttt{showalign}. Table~\ref{tbl:comparison} summarizes their
features.

\section*{Performance and Limits}

\texttt{termal} has been tested on alignments exceeding 15,000 sequences and
1,500 columns (∼22 million alignment cells), with startup and initial rendering
completing in under one second on a machine with 12th-generation
Intel\textregistered{} Core\textsuperscript{TM} i5-1240P CPU and 16 GB of RAM
running Linux 6.14.2. In practice, interactive performance is limited more by
the speed of the terminal emulator than by \texttt{termal} itself.
GPU-accelerated terminals such as Alacritty\cite{alacritty}, Kitty\cite{kitty}
and Ghostty\cite{ghostty} offer smoother scrolling at large screen sizes than do
more traditional emulators.

\section*{Availability}

\texttt{termal} is distributed under the <INSERT> license. It is available as a
single precompiled binary for Linux, macOS, and Windows, with no external
dependencies or runtime environment required. Alternatively, users with Rust
installed can install it via \texttt{cargo install termal}.

\section*{Conclusion}

While this work is not intended as a comprehensive review of alignment viewers,
we surveyed several tools with comparable goals — namely, terminal-native
operation and varying degrees of interactivity — including \texttt{showalign},
\texttt{alan}, \texttt{alv}, and \texttt{alen}.  To our knowledge,
\texttt{termal} is the only tool to combine interactive navigation, zooming,
consensus and conservation visualization, and customizable layout options in a
single terminal interface.  Its minimal dependencies and fast startup make
\texttt{termal} suitable for both ad-hoc use and for integration into
semi-automated workflows requiring terminal-based alignment review. Accordingly,
\texttt{termal} fills a niche for fast, interactive MSA exploration directly in
the terminal, making it an ideal tool for remote bioinformatics workflows.
