\maketitle

\begin{abstract} \textbf{Summary:} We present \texttt{termal}, a fast,
  interactive terminal-based viewer for multiple sequence alignments (MSAs),
  designed for use on remote systems such as high-performance computing (HPC)
  clusters. Unlike traditional graphical viewers, \texttt{termal} runs entirely
  within a terminal and offers features such as scrolling, zooming,
  consensus/conservation visualization, and customizable colour schemes. It is
  implemented in Rust, ensuring high performance and minimal dependencies.

	\textbf{Availability and implementation:} \texttt{termal} is written in Rust
	and freely available under the MIT license at
	\url{https://gitlab.sib.swiss/tjunier/termal.git}

\section*{Introduction}

Visualising multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) is a common task in
computational biology. Many alignment viewers have a graphical user interface
(GUI) and are hence unsuitable for use on headless or remote systems such as
high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.  Command-line tools do exist, for
example Alan\cite{alan}, which stands out as a particularly elegant solution,
since it is built on standard Unix tools such as \texttt{awk} and \texttt{less}
--- indeed, it served as the initial inspiration for the present work. This
means, however, that Alan's interactivity is limited to that of a pager:
features such as zooming, reordering sequences, as well as computing and
displaying a consensus sequence are absent. While
\texttt{showalign}\cite{emboss} can compute a consensus, it does not support
colouring residues, and the user must explicitly call a pager in order to scroll
through the alignment. Other programs like \texttt{alen}\cite{alen} are
interactive, but not all have built-in residue colour schemes or the ability to
visually represent metrics such as similarity to the consensus, or to reorder
sequences according to such metrics. The capacity to fit a large alignment on
screen, typically by only displaying a subset of the sequences and columns, is
also rare (see also table~\ref{tbl:comparison}). In summary, text-based MSA
viewers collectively provide a substantial range of functions, but no viewer
implements all, or even most, of them. In this work we introduce
\texttt{termal}, which combines most of these features in a single application.

\section*{Interface}

Apart from the alignment sequences, which occupy the main pane, \texttt{termal}
also displays sequence labels and  ordinal numbers, a consensus sequence, and a
conservation bar plot; it also displays sequence metrics such as similarity to
the consensus, or (ungapped) length (figure~\ref{fig:screen}). The alignment can
be scrolled one sequence/column at a time using arrow keys or Vim-like
\texttt{h}, \texttt{j}, \texttt{k}, and \texttt{l}; similar keystrokes allow
jumping by screenfuls or to the edges of the alignment.

By default, residues of nucleotide alignments are coloured according to
Jalview's\cite{waterhouse2009jalview} nucleotide colour scheme, while protein
alignments use that of ClustalX\cite{larkin2007clustal}. An alternative colour
scheme for protein is Lesk's\cite{lesk2019introduction}, and all alignments can
be rendered in monochrome. 

Alignments too wide to fit on the screen can be "zoomed out" by showing only the
first and last column, as well as a sample of equidistant columns in between.
The same can be done with sequences for alignments that are too tall. This
allows regions of high conservation to be spotted without scrolling. A variant
of the zoomed-out mode preserves the alignment's aspect ratio, at the cost of
some wasted space.

The sequences can be reordered according to the currently-displayed sequence
metric, in increasing or decreasing order. This allows e.g. to group the most
complete sequences together, or those that best match the consensus.

The width of the label pane can be adjusted to fit label length, and both the
side and bottom panes can be hidden to maximise the space allocated to the
alignment.

\texttt{termal} comes with a built-in help screen that lists all key bindings.

	alignment is displayed. }

\section*{Performance and Limitations}

\texttt{termal} has been tested on alignments exceeding 15,000 sequences and
1,500 columns (∼22 million alignment cells), with startup and initial rendering
completing in under one second on a machine with 12th-generation
Intel\textregistered{} Core\textsuperscript{TM} i5-1240P CPU and 16 GB of RAM
running Linux 6.14.2. In practice, interactive performance is limited more by
the speed of the terminal emulator than by \texttt{termal} itself.
GPU-accelerated terminals such as Alacritty\cite{alacritty}, Kitty\cite{kitty}
and Ghostty\cite{ghostty} offer smoother scrolling at large screen sizes than do
more traditional emulators.

\section*{Availability}

\texttt{termal} is distributed under the MIT license. It is available as a
single precompiled binary (for Linux, MacOS, and Windows), with no external
dependencies or runtime environment required, from
\url{gitlab.sib.swiss/tjunier/termal.git}. Alternatively, users with Rust
installed can install it via \texttt{cargo install termal}.

\section*{Conclusion}

While this work is not intended as a comprehensive review of alignment viewers,
we surveyed several tools with comparable goals — namely, terminal-native
operation and varying degrees of interactivity — including \texttt{showalign},
\texttt{alan}, \texttt{alv}, and \texttt{alen}.  To our knowledge,
\texttt{termal} is the only tool to combine interactive navigation, zooming,
consensus and conservation visualization, several built-in colour maps, as well
as display of and ordering by sequence metrics in a single terminal interface.
Its minimal dependencies and fast startup make \texttt{termal} suitable for both
ad-hoc use and for integration into semi-automated workflows requiring
terminal-based alignment review. Accordingly, \texttt{termal} fills a niche for
fast, interactive MSA exploration directly in the terminal, making it an ideal
tool for remote bioinformatics workflows.
