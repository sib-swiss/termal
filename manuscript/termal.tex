\begin{abstract} \textbf{Summary:} We present \texttt{termal}, a fast,
  interactive terminal-based viewer for multiple sequence alignments (MSAs),
  designed for use on remote systems such as high-performance computing (HPC)
  clusters. Unlike traditional graphical viewers, \texttt{termal} runs entirely
  within a terminal and offers features such as scrolling, zooming,
  consensus/conservation visualization, and customizable color schemes. It is
  implemented in Rust, ensuring high performance and minimal dependencies.

  \textbf{Availability and implementation:} \texttt{termal} is written in Rust
  and freely available under the MIT license at
  \url{https://github.com/youruser/termal}.

\section*{Introduction}

Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) visualization is a common task in
computational biology, yet many tools are GUI-based and unsuitable for use on
headless or remote systems such as HPC clusters. While command-line tools such
as \texttt{showalign} from the EMBOSS suite\cite{emboss} exist, they are limited
in interactivity and display features. \texttt{termal} addresses this gap by
providing a responsive, feature-rich terminal interface for exploring MSAs.
Among terminal-based alignment viewers, Alan\cite{alan} stands out as a
particularly elegant solution, leveraging standard Unix tools such as
\texttt{less} and \texttt{awk} to enable minimalist inspection of multiple
sequence alignments. Indeed, it served as the initial inspiration for the
development of \texttt{termal}. However, Alan is limited by its static output and lack of
interactivity: while scrolling and searching are available through less,
features such as zooming, interactive navigation, consensus/conservation
highlighting, and multiple color schemes are absent.  \texttt{termal} builds on Alan’s
philosophy of terminal-first simplicity, but provides a richer and more
responsive user experience by incorporating a fully interactive terminal UI and
enhanced alignment rendering.

\section*{Implementation}

\texttt{termal} is implemented in Rust using a modular terminal user interface
(TUI) architecture. It supports common MSA formats such as FASTA and Clustal,
and displays aligned sequences with interactive navigation (keyboard-based
scrolling and zooming), consensus/conservation overlays, and customizable color
schemes. It is distributed as a single static binary for ease of installation
and deployment on remote systems.

\section*{Comparison with Existing Tools}

We compared \texttt{termal} with existing terminal-based viewers including
\texttt{alv} and \texttt{showalign}. Table~\ref{tab:comparison} summarizes their
features.

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline
Feature                 & \texttt{termal} & \texttt{alv} & \texttt{showalign} \\
\hline
Terminal-based          & Yes             & Yes          & Yes                \\
Interactive scrolling   & Yes             & Partial      & No                 \\

\section*{Performance and Limits}

\texttt{termal} has been tested on alignments exceeding 15,000 sequences and
1,500 columns (∼22 million alignment cells), with startup and initial rendering
completing in under one second on a machine with 12th-generation
Intel\textregistered{} Core\textsuperscript{TM} i5-1240P CPU and 16 GB of RAM
running Linux 6.14.2. In practice, interactive performance is limited more by
the speed of the terminal emulator than by \texttt{termal} itself.
GPU-accelerated terminals such as Alacritty\cite{alacritty}, Kitty\cite{kitty}
and Ghostty\cite{ghostty} offer smoother scrolling at large screen sizes than do
more traditional emulators.

\section*{Availability}

\texttt{termal} is implemented in Rust and distributed under the MIT license. It
is available as a single precompiled binary for Linux, macOS, and Windows, with
no external dependencies or runtime environment required. Alternatively, users
with Rust installed can install it via \texttt{cargo install termal}.

\section*{Conclusion}

While this work is not intended as a comprehensive review of alignment viewers,
we surveyed several tools with comparable goals — namely, terminal-native
operation and varying degrees of interactivity — including \texttt{showalign},
\texttt{alan}, \texttt{alv}, and \texttt{alen}.  To our knowledge,
\texttt{termal} is the only tool to combine interactive navigation, zooming,
consensus and conservation visualization, and customizable layout options in a
single terminal interface.  Its minimal dependencies and fast startup make
\texttt{termal} suitable for both ad-hoc use and for integration into
semi-automated workflows requiring terminal-based alignment review. Accordingly,
\texttt{termal} fills a niche for fast, interactive MSA exploration directly in
the terminal, making it an ideal tool for remote bioinformatics workflows.
